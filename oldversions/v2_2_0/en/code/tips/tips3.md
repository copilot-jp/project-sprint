Many things are produced in a project, and distinguishing the names according to the meaning and granularity of each of them can facilitate communication among team members and help the project succeed.

In this article, it will explain "outputs" and "deliverables" as used in Project Sprint.

#### Outputs
Outputs are tangible, **tangible things** that are produced as a result of team members completing their assigned work (tasks). It is the smallest unit in the term that describes what is produced through a project.


#### Deliverables
A deliverable is **a collection of outputs** that should have been produced at the completion of a milestone. Milestone "outcomes" are composed of "deliverables" and "desired state"
