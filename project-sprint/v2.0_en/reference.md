### Psychological Safety
This concept was proposed by Amy Edmondson. I share the importance of creating an environment where people believe it is safe to say whatever they want in a team.
It was brought to attention by Google's research project on highly productive teams.

### Sense-Making Theory
This is a theory developed by Carl Weik and others. I agree with the idea of focusing on team buy-in rather than accuracy.
