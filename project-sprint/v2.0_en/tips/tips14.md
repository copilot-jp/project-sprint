# Tips14: The Purpose of an Agenda

As mentioned in [Project Sprint 101](../tutorial/project-sprint-101.md), an agenda in a Project Sprint is "a clear statement of a team member's activities in a project that is shared and recognized by other team members. And how to create a specific agenda is explained in[ Preparing for a meeting](../tutorial/2-1.md) and [All elements that should be included in the agenda](tips8.md).

In this article, we will discuss the purpose of an agenda in order to understand it more deeply. Agendas can be divided into three types, depending on the purpose of the discussion

* Divergence: When a wide range of options emerge through the discussion.
* Convergence: When a number of options are narrowed down to a single option through discussion.
* Sharing: When you want to share information or confirm assumptions.

By indicating in advance which category the agenda will fall into, meeting participants can understand from which perspective and what they should say. For example, if the agenda is a "divergent" agenda, people can freely express their opinions, and it is important to come up with new ideas. On the other hand, if the agenda is "convergent," it is necessary to draw realistic conclusions about what kind of output should be produced in order to achieve the milestone. In addition, if the agenda is for "sharing," it is important to ask questions and make sure that everyone is on the same page as much as possible.
