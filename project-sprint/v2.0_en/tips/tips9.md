# Tips9: Typical Looking Back Techniques

Reflection in Project Sprint is an effort to improve activities in each domain of progress, process, and teaming by having team members review the contents of past projects.

There are a variety of general "look back" methods, but here we will introduce two methods that are relatively easy to implement and highly versatile as examples.

## KPT
KPT is a method in which team members look back on a project and share their impressions of "good things (Keep)" and "things to improve (Problem)", and discuss "things to work on for improvement (Try)".

### Example procedure
1. Each team member writes "Keep" and "Problem" on a sticky note.
2. When the team members have finished filling in the sticky notes, explain the Keep and Problem they have filled in and post them on the whiteboard for sharing.
3. Among the stickies on the whiteboard, summarize those that are related or can be summarized into a theme.
4. Each team member fills in a Try on a sticky note.
5. When the team members have finished filling in the stickies, explain the Try they have filled in and share them on the whiteboard.
6. Decide which "Try" you will actually work on.

## +/Î” (Plus/Delta)
+/-Delta is a method for team members to share their impressions of the project so far: "plus" = what is going well and what they want to continue doing, and "delta" = what they want to improve. It is similar to KPT, but it is simpler to implement because there are two ways to divide the opinions.

### Example procedure
1. Each team member writes a plus and a delta on a sticky note.
2. When they are done, each team member explains the pluses and deltas they have written and puts them on the whiteboard to share.
3. Among the stickies on the whiteboard, summarize the ones that are related or can summarize the theme.
4. Discuss ideas for improvement in the teams.
5. Among the ideas that come up, decide which ones you will actually work on.

## YWT
YWT is a method in which team members share what they have done (Y), what they have learned (W), and what they will do next (T) in a project. The advantage of this method is that by starting with a review of what you have actually experienced, you can have a more down-to-earth discussion.

### Example of procedure
1. Each team member writes down "What we did (Y)" on a sticky note.
2. When they are done, each team member explains what he or she has done and puts it on the whiteboard to share.
3. Among the stickies on the whiteboard, summarize the ones that are related or can summarize the theme.
4. Each team member writes "What I learned (W)" on a sticky note.
5. When the team members have finished filling in the sticky notes, share them on the whiteboard while each team member explains what he or she has filled in.
6. Among the stickies on the whiteboard, summarize those that are related or can be used to summarize the theme.
7. Each team member writes "What to do next (T)" on a sticky note.
8. When the team members have finished filling out the sticky notes, they explain what they have done and share them on the whiteboard.
9. Decide which of the "Next Tasks" you will actually work on.
