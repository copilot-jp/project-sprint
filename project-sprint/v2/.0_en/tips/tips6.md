# Tips6: Using a Roll Sheet

As mentioned in the section on [Knowing your team members and setting their roles](../tutorial/1-2.md), roles are the roles of individual team members. Roles and team members do not necessarily have a one-to-one relationship, and while there is no set type of role, the roles that are set must be clearly defined and agreed upon.

For this reason, it is recommended to use a "role sheet" to clearly state the "current role status" and keep it available for reference.

For example, the following elements should be included in the role sheet.

* Role name
* Responsibilities of the role (for what purpose the role is needed and what the role is to accomplish)
* The person who will be responsible for the role

Putting these together as a single document and keeping it up-to-date will allow you to understand the current expectations of each member and discuss any discrepancies with those expectations.
